The Roslyn Language Implementation API for adding custom language support/syntax highlighting features to your own language or one that is .NET already and you wish to use/employ the Roslyn Toolchain for it. (Language packages like the C#, VBScript or I guess also F# are now slick APIs that are slimmed and made efficient and specific and propriety for that specific job and all that good stuff.) I hope you enjoyed reading this! For now no more information for you, :(. Soon API documentations and specs once I get started on my language though and have it somewhat working!.
